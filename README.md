##A guide for YouMessage

###What is YouMessage?
    YouMessage is an anonymous messaging website.  You may send anonymous messages to anyone, provided you know their user ID - this ID
    is automatically embeded in the link they may send you.  

###How does it work?
    With default settings, anyone who visits the link will see every message anyone has sent.  Some users may not like this, so, when you create
    your page, click the "Use a password button".  Then, fill out the provided password form.  Now, when anyone visits your page, they need a
    password to view your messages.  However, anyone can still send messages, just like before.
