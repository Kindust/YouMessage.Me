# YouMessage.Me
*A guide for YouMessage*

## What is YouMessage?
YouMessage is an anonymous messaging website.  You may send anonymous messages to anyone, provided you know their user ID - this ID
is automatically embeded in the link they may send you.  

## How does it work?
With default settings, anyone who visits the link will see every message anyone has sent.  Some users may not like this, so, when you create
your page, click the "Use a password button".  Then, fill out the provided password form.  Now, when anyone visits your page, they need a
password to view your messages.  However, anyone can still send messages, just like before.

## I'm still confused, can't you just show me?
Sure!

### Creating a page (**WITHOUT** PASSWORD)

First, go to the home page, and scroll to the bottom ![Home page](/s1.JPG)

Next, type in whatever name you like.  It doesn't have to be yours. ![Name entered](/s2.JPG)

Click "Create Account".  At the next page, you have the option to view your page (highlight #1), or copy your link (highlight #2).  ![Next page](/s3.JPG)

When you visit your page, this is what you should see.  **Others will see this too when they go to your page**. ![Your page](/s4.JPG)

### Creating a page (**WITH** PASSWORD)

Go to the home page, and scroll to the bottom.  Enter a name, and click "Use a password".  Enter a password to protect your page with. ![Home page](/sa1.JPG)

Next, click "Create Account".  Now, you have the option to view your page (highlight #1), or copy your link (highlight #2). ![New account](/s3.JPG)

When you're at your new page, this is what you should see.  Note the form titled ** "Enter your password to see hidden messages.
" ** .  By putting your password into the box & clicking the button, you will be able to view all of your messages. ![Your page](/sa4.JPG)

If someone sends you a message, and you check your page, you will see this.  **Note: you will only see those messages once you've entered your password.  Your messages are still safe!** ![Viewing a message](/sa5.JPG)

### Sending a message

In order to send a message, click "Message (your name)".  The field for a name is optional, and should not be **accurately** filled out if you wish to remain anonymous ![Sending a message](/s5.JPG)

Congratulations!  You've sent a message.  Please note, this picture shows a page on which "TestUser" chose not to have a password, which is why you can see the message.  If you wish to make messages be private, read on.  ![Message sent](/s6.JPG)
