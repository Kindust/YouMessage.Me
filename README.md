# YouMessage.Me
*A guide for YouMessage*

## What is YouMessage?
YouMessage is an anonymous messaging website.  You may send anonymous messages to anyone, provided you know their user ID - this ID
is automatically embeded in the link they may send you.  

## How does it work?
With default settings, anyone who visits the link will see every message anyone has sent.  Some users may not like this, so, when you create
your page, click the "Use a password button".  Then, fill out the provided password form.  Now, when anyone visits your page, they need a
password to view your messages.  However, anyone can still send messages, just like before.

## I'm still confused, can't you just show me?
Sure!


First, go to the home page, and scroll to the bottom ![Home page](/s1.JPG)

Next, type in whatever name you like.  It doesn't have to be yours. ![Name entered](/s2.JPG)

Click "Create Account".  At the next page, you have the option to view your page (highlight #1), or copy your link (highlight #2).  ![Next page](/s3.JPG)

When you visit your page, this is what you should see.  Others will see this too when they go to your page. ![Your page](/s4.JPG)

### Sending a message

In order to send a message, click "Message (your name)".  The field for a name is optional, and should not be **accurately** filled out if you wish to remain anonymous ![Sending a message](/s5.JPG)
 
Congratulations!  You've sent a message.  Please note, this picture shows a page on which "TestUser" chose not to have a password, which is why you can see the message.  If you wish to make messages be private, read on.  ![Message sent](/s6.JPG)
